# What are Convolutional Neural Networks?
There are a lot of concepts in Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) that need to be covered. Here we'll go through each of them. CNNs can be thought of as two concepts, one being a neural network and the other being organized via convolutions.

### Neural Networks
Neural Networks are systems of several simple elements interconnected among each other that are trained and adjusted to some requested output for some given input.
#### Input, Hidden, Output Layers
#### Weights, Biases, Activation Functions

#### Inference/Training

#### Back Propagation




#### Convolution
##### Kernel Sizes, Strides

### Convolutional Neural Networks
#### Convolution Layer
#### Pooling
#### Fully Connected Layer


## Uses

### Classification
#### Classification Layer
### Regression

### Segmentation
#### Full Pixel Layer
